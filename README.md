# JS Projects

Within this repo I intend to share all the smaller Vanilla JavaScript apps or tutortials I complete. Below is a list of all the projects:

- JS Calculator
  - A simple JS Calculator built from a tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw "Build A Calculator With JavaScript Tutorial").
